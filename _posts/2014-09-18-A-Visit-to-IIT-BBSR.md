Today I had fun exploring **[IIT Bhubaneswar Campus ](http://www.iitbbs.ac.in/) **. I am finding my own ways to interact with new people and trying to get *involved* in some research opportunities. Hopefully I can if manage my time, I will be working on concolic testing which is  a form of advanced black box testing. I have preferred to work near by home so that I can get time for side projects and research. From my current knowledge opensourcing is mostly about application, implementation and improvement of technology. Research relates to possibility of technology <!--excerpt--> in wide area, journal and conference stuffs. But these two things are primarily based on the same essence of loving what you do and have lot of things in common in terms of fun with what you create and the possibility of how it serve others.

> Back to my thought about the campus,the IIT Bhubaneswar Campus is primarily based on **Toshali Plaza** ,Gajapati Nagar.It's a nine storied **huge building** (*in my town that's considered big*). Most of the lab and research for PhD and M.Tech graduates are held there.Here's the view...
