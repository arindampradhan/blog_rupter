Today I had fun exploring **[IIT Bhubaneswar Campus](http://www.iitbbs.ac.in/) **.I am finding my own ways to interact with new people and trying to find some research oppertunities.Yup,I also have some intrest in research and I have approached a teacher so that I could get a strong hold on my **research area**.From my current knowledge opensourcing is mostly about application,implementation and improvement of technology.Research relates to possibility of technology<!--excerpt--> in wide area, journal and conference stuffs.But these two things are primarily based on the same essence of loving what you do and having lots of fun with what you create and it's pssibility to serve others.
> I have been talking to Dr. Manoranjan Satpathy and he is giving me few simple tasks to understand about software testing component.I have completed reading his journal and soon am going to complete the book "" .I have planned to write few application regarding to my research work to get some practical idea with my research.

>Back to my thought about the campus,the IIT Bhubaneswar Campus is primarily based on **Toshali Plaza** ,Gajapati Nagar.It's a nine storied **huge building** (in my town/city that's considered **big**). Most of the lab and research for PhD and M.Tech graduates are held there.Here's a view...

>And the Campus has also a **kharagpur extension**,most of the classes and labs currently held there are for the B.tech undergraduate students(mostly core engineers).Most of the **workshops** are there.All the building are developing soon and there a number of tenders currently running.
