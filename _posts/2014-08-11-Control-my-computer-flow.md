How do you maintain your projects with all the devices and application in a perfect sync?How do you work perfectly in a order that effectively makes your work smoother and effective.Well the answer could be *dropbox* but still I am talking about a more synchronized way of doing things on your computer. 

>What do you call your zen of workflow?

##My Zen of w***??

Yes, the state in which you feel no difference and no expectation ,although that corresponds to nothing I am f***ing talking about.

Well I was taking about a few apps and settings that can boost your productivity in daily life.

##Learn to confgure your linux

>Linux is kind of like a piece of open art.It only 
gets beautiful for you the way you paint(configure) it.

I am not talking about the gui tools and application.I am talking about a few tools you can use to make your self in a zen

So here's the list:

*tmux
*youtube-dl (youtube video downloader)
*cmus (music player requires mplayer)
*mplayer 
*pyradio (radio)

These are some of the ncurses that you can use for daily use can.And trust me they will provide more functionlity then anything you have ever seen.I will look like these...
