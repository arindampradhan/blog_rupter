This year I attended pycon india,eager to meet some of the greatest minds in the opensource world.
The keynote started with Kushal Das...and he shared some of his wonderful experiences he had in python.,How he began his journey.
	He has also been contributing to a wide variety of upstream projects.

>Upstream a powerful word I came across.

My schedule
===========

It's tough because this time they had parallel talks.So I always need to choose..They all seem intresting.And all were 45min talk.

Anyways,I decided to go to:
* Python + Spark: Lightning Fast Cluster Computing(Jyotiska NK)

* Django Design Patterns(Arun Ravindran)

* Messing with government data using Python(Anand Chitipothu)

* Ya the lunch was great too.

* Meet ElasticSearch - My Pet Crunch Monster(Dhananjay Sathe)

* GPU accelerated high performance computing primer
(Gurajapu Raja Suman)

>The most facinating talk for me was Messing with government data using Python
- Anand Chitipothu

I have a huge intrest in datamining.And I got to know about small hacks.

Mostly I used beautifulsoup and requests...
Now I am going to give a shot to scrapy and mechanize..
They seem to differ as they can trigger things at runtime.

The talk for elastic search was good too.I am a newbie at database stuffs.But still good to attend some new stuffs.


My schedule for next day :
===========================


* Async IO for Dummies(Vajrasky Kok)

* Building highly scalable web-services with Gevent - experiences at Plivo
Aditya Manthramurthy

* Faster data processing in Python(Anand S)


*Graph everything with Neo4J and Python
(Sonal Raj)

>I loved this day...I loved Faster data processing in Python(Anand S).
The simplitsity of the talk was amazing.It was a benchmarks topic.

He not only showed ways,but python libraries to use for faster data processing  and also urged people to think whether they need the speed or not.

He started with a simple program that reads a csv file and formats the required data for votes in a state in perticular year.He explored the data stories visually with Python and Javascript.

>He optimised his code as fluent as one can get in algorithms.

Using basic python,he used cpython then pypy @jit to optimize the code.It stared with a runtime of 1.5 millisec to microsec in cpython to nanosec in @jit.

This was seriously amazing.
