<h1>Arindam Pradhan</h1>	
<p> Hi ,I am Arindam Pradhan 20,I live in a small town Bhubaneswar in Orissa. I am an electrical engineer undergraduate at <a href="http://cet.edu.in/">CET,Bhubaneswar</a>.</p>
<p>I have a keen intrest on FOOS and Competitive Programming. I enjoy programming because it's fun, keeps me focused and calm. Have a look at my <a href="https://github.com/arindampradhan">github</a>, these are some of my *works*. Currenty I am self teaching, I follow mostly blogs, tutorials and github projects. I easily get motivated a lot and my dream is to be the best programmer, master a single language and write lots(tons) of code like the the other great ideals.<br/>

I am a foodie and love french fries, hell ya I love playing games and try to complete them in a day. So, I get addicted to lots of caffine and coke. </p>
